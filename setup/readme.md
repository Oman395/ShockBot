# Arduino setup
These are placeholder instructions, we will improve them later.
1. Install nodejs; if you're on linux, you'll know how to do this-- windows people, just look up "nodejs" and install the latest release.
2. Linux users can skip to blank, the next steps are for windows only.
3. Open up powershell by typing "pwsh" into the search bar
4. Open up your folder and navigate to where you downloaded this repository
5. Copy the file path from the top bar
6. Run "cd {path you copied}" in the powershell window
7. Linux users, just navigate to the path where you cloned the repo in your terminal.
8. Run "cd setup"
9. Run "npm i" to install dependencies
10. Run "node flash.js {type of arduino}"
11. That should be it!
